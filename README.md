# Youtube-video-downloader

This project is a simple yet powerful tool for downloading YouTube videos directly to your computer. As a student passionate about technology and practical solutions, I developed this project to demonstrate my programming skills and ability to create real-world applications. This downloader can be particularly helpful for offline viewing, educational purposes, or preserving important content.

Why I Made This Project?

Downloading YouTube videos is a common need, but many people struggle to find reliable tools that respect simplicity and functionality. I built this project to:
Learn about Python libraries like pytube and tkinter.
And Create a user-friendly interface for selecting save locations using dialog boxes.
Additionally, I aimed to build something practical that showcases my technical skills in a way that aligns with everyday problems people face.
